# Project1sandbox

Our Project analyzes data from APIs that we pulled from government websites such as EIA.gov to test our hypothesis that the Ukraine War had an effect on commodity prices.

We analyzed Fuel, Grain, Fuel Sources, and the US Dollar/Russian Ruble and the changes that happened after Russia attacked Ukraine.

Our Powerpoint Presentation shows the data we pulled in easy to read graphs and details what is shown in each set of data.
